File1:
And I your willing victim
And we can haha learn to love again
And with every touch you fixed them
Between haha our love, our love, oh our love, our love
I thought that we were fine
Im sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
It's in the stars
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
LOST.txt:
My dear we still have everything
No such files or directory
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Of our love, our love
Oh oh
Oh we had everything haha
Right from haha the start
Tell me that you've had enough
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Things you never haha say to me
You were a thief you stole my heart
Your head is running wild again
