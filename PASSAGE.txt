Fashion is a general term for a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear,
accessories, makeup, body piercing, or furniture.
Fashion refers to a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style
in which a person dresses or to prevailing styles in behaviour.
Fashion also refers to the newest creations of textile designers.
The more technical term costume has become so linked to its term
that the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear,
while Fashion means clothing more generally, including the study of it.
Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.
